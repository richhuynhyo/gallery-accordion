#Rich Gallery Accordian

Simple, Responsive Gallery with drop down accordian feature.

##Fully Customizeable
With minimal base stylings for this plugin, the user has full control of its stylings.

## Reduce Unnecessary Server Load/Requests 
Additional images are loaded only after the user clicks on a preview. This helps reduce unncessary server requests.

## XML Data 
Updating "Drop Down" information is made easier by isolating it onto an XML file. Add full blocks of HTML to rg_dropdownData.xml.  

## Templating
Advanced users can streamline consistent "Drop Down" by adding additional fields to the XML file and HTML template.
